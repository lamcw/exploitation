This project contains a series of simple binaries designed to teach basic
exploitation. Challenges are separated by difficulty, escalating onwards from
0x00.

Each challenge provides a binary and a README explaining the challenge. The
source code is publicly available but should not be used to solve the
challenge. Some challenges, particularly the early challenges, require that
address space randomisation is disabled on the operating system. This and
other challenge specific details are described in the associated README.

Sample solutions are provided.

Build dependencies include:
* GCC or Clang
* Meson
* Ninja

Releases can be found on the release page.

Building the exercises can be done from the source directory by running:
$ meson build --prefix $(pwd)/install
$ ninja -C build

Installing can be done by:
$ ninja -C build install
